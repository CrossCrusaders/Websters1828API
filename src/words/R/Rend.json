To separate any substance into parts with force or sudden violence; to tear asunder; to split; as, powder rends a rock in blasting; lightning rends an oak.An empire from its old foundation rent.I rend my tresses, and by breast I wound.Neither rend your clothes, lest ye die. Leviticus 10:6.\n2. To separate or part with violence.I will surely rend the kingdom from thee. 1 Kings 11:11.To rend the heart, in Scripture, to have bitter sorrow for sin. Joel 2:13.To rend the heavens, to appear in majesty. Isaiah 64:1.REND differs somewhat from lacerate. We never say, to lacerate a rock or a kingdom, when we mean to express splitting or division. Lacerate is properly applicable to the tearing off of small pieces of a thing, as to lacerate the body with a whip or scourge; or to the tearing of the flesh or other thing without entire separation."

To palpitate; to beat with preternatural violence or rapidity, as the heart in terror, or after hard labor, or in anxious desire or suspense.\nYet might her piteous heart be seen to pant and quake.\n2. To have the breast heaving, as in short respiration or want of breath.\nPluto pants for breath from out his cell.\n3. To play with intermission or declining strength.\nThe whispering breeze\nPants on the leaves and dies upon the trees.\n4. To long; to desire ardently.\nWho pants for glory, finds but short repose.\nAs the heart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God. Psalms 42:1."

  "pronunciation": "ENJOIN', [Latin injungo. See Join. We observe that the primary sense of join is to set, extend or lay to, to throw to or on; otherwise the sense of order or command could not spring from it. To enjoin is to set or lay to or on.]",

    {
      "type": "verb transitive",
      "text": "1. To order or direct with urgency; to admonish or instruct with authority; to command. Says Johnson, 'this word is more authoritative than direct, and less imperious than command.' It has the force of pressing admonition with authority; as, a parent enjoins on his children the duty of obedience. But it has also the sense of command; as the duties enjoined by God the moral law.\n2. In law, to forbid judicially; to issue or direct a legal injunction to stop proceedings. This is a suit to enjoin the defendants from disturbing the plaintiffs."
